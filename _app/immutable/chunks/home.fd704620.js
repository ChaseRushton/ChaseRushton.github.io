I have proven experience collaborating with bioinformaticians and molecular specialists across the hospital network to swiftly transition from analysis proof-of-concept to production-grade analysis pipelines for cancer detection, annotation, and custom database integration. My expertise lies in oncology and next-generation sequencing (NGS), where I excel at building robust, reproducible, and scalable NGS workflows. I possess a high-level knowledge of the current and future state of the growing industry for managing and processing NGS data. Additionally, I have experience in designing and implementing strategies to develop scalable genomics infrastructure (AWS, HPC, IAP). I have executed custom analysis pipelines on read-level data across extensive datasets, including TCGA, GOAL consortium, and UPHS clinical patients, translating the results into actionable insights.",r=[{platform:t.GitHub,link:"https://github.com/"},{platform:t.Linkedin,link:"https://www.linkedin.com/"},{platform:t.Twitter,link:"https://twitter.com/"},{platform:t.StackOverflow,link:"https://stackoverflow.com/"},{platform:t.Email,link:"riadh_adrani@hotmail.fr"},{platform:t.Youtube,link:"https://www.youtube.com"},{platform:t.Facebook,link:"https://www.facebook.com"}],c=a("js","css","html","reactjs","sass","svelte","ts");export{r as a,l as d,s as l,n,c as s,i as t};
